## Inspiration 
[Favourite Albums](favourite-albums.netlify.app) is a personal project I've developed to showcase a few of my favourite albums across a wide range of different genres! I originally got inspired by a fellow music nerd friend who listed their favourite albums over a Google Docs. However, I was unsatisfied with the limited layout and performance that this format provided, so I decided to switch over to a website!

## Process
At first, I began the design on a Google Docs file, playing around with the width and the options for the layout. I became frustrated with the limitations given by Google Docs, and how the visuals increasingly made the document slower in performance.

I moved on to a website format, initially using HTML and CSS to display my work. However, the code was lengthy, and often repeated tags. As I continued to learn more about front-end development, I learned that there were easier ways to clean up my code, and eliminate repeating sections. 

I then created my React application. Using a combination of React Components, JSX, and Styled Components, I was able to create more generally concise and clean code.

## Future Goals 
### Responsivity
Another aspect of the Google Docs format that frustrated me was the lack of responsivity to different sizes if you were to move beyond its default format (such as increasing the width, modifying the margin, etc.). I hope to make my website more responsive in the future, modifying the style depending on the size of the screen, and making it visually pleasing in the process. 

### Accessibility
I also hope to make my website more accessible, by adding tags that are more descriptive, alt text, creating simpler navigation, and creating a smoother path for moving through the website. I am doing deeper research on accessibilty standards to improve the overall performance of my website in this regard!
